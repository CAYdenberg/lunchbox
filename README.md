# üç± Lunchbox
``Hello ( ¬¥ œâ ` )„ÉéÔæû`` Welcome to üç± Lunchbox. So... you're into Deno ü¶ï Fresh üçã? Damn, me too. I've found myself using nothing but Fresh for most of my web dev projects. But I'm not that much of a user of existing web component libraries. Even though I respect these, I'm more of a _do-it-yourself_ kind of guy. That is why I created Lunchbox, and I couldn't help creating an opinionated product that is built to have my dream features.

## Ideas behind the library
Alright, so what are these features? Instead of listing what can _technically_ be done with this library, the way to describe it is by its core ideas. 

### Based on [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/)
Shoutout to [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/), thank you for this great piece of work.  A popular concept about modularity in design systems is to consider them inherently hierarchical. In this, I strongly disagree because atoms are of no less importance than organisms. But I do agree that they have one fundamentally different characteristic. Atoms are components only made by nature's _subatomic particles_ a.k.a. pure HTML Elements. Am I stretching too far with the atomic analogy?

### Trivial HTML good practices
Component libraries are usually ambiguous about how they handle inner logic, creating the need to _find out how does it do X_. For example, some might have only one component for both `<input/>` and `<textarea/>`, which might change depending on a prop. "Or was it something else? Wait, what was the name of the class that changes when it's a TextArea?" Having it closer to the HTML Element logic makes the inner logic of the components really obvious and apparent.

Let's take as an example the `<Input>` component. When using it you're expected to use the best practices with it, plus additional features. These best practices are multidisciplinary. The field of UX foments the use of a label and a contextual error message to guide the user. That gives us the props `<Input label="" error="" />`. These features are not native to the simple `<input />` HTEML element, it must work together with other elements. It is in this next area where the good practices aren't forgotten. Like nesting the input inside a label element (`<label><input /></label>`). Finally, every visual element inside the component was designed to maintain a perfect vertical rhythm for good aesthetic practices even in the aesthetics of the interface.

### Configure anything easily
Let us continue with the example of the `<Input />` component. As a very strict rule, all components must be able to render a useful default state without any defined prop. so simply using `<Input />` will create a functional input field even without a label or anything. Likewise, styles and CSS classes are optional and can be removed with the universal prop `nostyles`. 

Also, additional classes can be appended simply by adding a class to the component. Having `<Input class="x" />` will add the class `"x"` to the `<input />` element inside it. Additionally, a reference can be forwarded to the same element using the universal prop `fref` like this. Having `<Input fref={inputRef} />` will forward the reference to the `<input />` element inside it. 

Every HTML Element and framework component that make up a particular component will be called a _"piece"_. Every piece of every component can be referenced using the universal component `fwd`. This is an oversimplified html code for the `<Input />` component:
```html
                      <!-- Piece name: -->
<div>                 <!-- wrapper -->
	<label>           <!-- label -->
		<span></span> <!-- text -->
		<input />     <!-- input (default reference) -->
	</label>
	<span></span>     <!-- error -->
</div>
```
The piece name is used in the CSS classes (`comp-#NAME#_#PIECE#`) and in the `fwd` prop (`<Input fwd={{ label: {class: 'x'} }}` will add the class `'x'` to the piece "label").

## Getting started
Deno counts with various ways of importing modules, for example the good ol' url import:
```ts
import { Button } from 'https://deno.land/x/lunchbox@vX.X.X/mod.ts'
```
But let's be reasonable, almost nobody would do something like this, you would have to update multiple files and imports whenever the module updates. Personally, I'm more of an `import_map.json`.
```json
{
  "imports": {
    "lunchbox": "https://deno.land/x/lunchbox@v0.1.13/mod.ts"
  }
}
```
This way, the usage would be really clean and easier to maintain:
```tsx
import { Button } from 'lunchbox';

export default function() {
	return <Button>Click Me!</Button>
}
```
